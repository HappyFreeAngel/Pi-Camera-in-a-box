## Pi-Camera-in-a-box
Pi-Camera-in-a-box is a Docker based setup which will turn any Raspberry Pi with a Camera Module into a live streaming webcam/CCTV system.

After purchasing a Raspberry Pi and the Camera Module, I was disappointed by some of the most common packages out there. The quality of the footage was poor, and the FPS was extremely low. I was not satisfied with 640x480 resolution at 2fps. 

After a lot of research and many helpful blogs (see credits), I was finally able to get a 25FPS, 1920/1080 stream into my Web Browser. This wasn't the simplest thing to do, and hence this project was spawned.

Pi-Camera-in-a-box will take a vanilla Raspberry Pi with a Camera Module and provide you with a HD 25FPS stream directly to your browser. It also includes authentication to prevent unauthorised users accessing your stream.
